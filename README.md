This Project is written in Python with the pandas, seaborn and numpy libraries

The project makes a dataframe on NHL teams through the years 2008-2021 by cleaning and preparing the data from multiple csv files

The dataframe is then both analyzed and visualized with python and the above libraries

The data set is also exported to csv for use in Tableau

Some Steps Taken
- Importing csv files
- Combining different files into one dataframe
- Cleaning and checking the data for errors
- Filtering the data frame for desired columns
- Exporting to csv for use in Tableau
- Graphical analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Heat maps
- Aggregation functions
